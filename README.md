# ChatForum
ChatForum made as a school finals project. <br>
Worked on in less than a month (less than 10 days in overall time) <br>
Made small fixes and changes after a month <br>
php artisan serve <br>


Feel free to download and use/edit whatever you like. <br>
Remember MySQL database isn't in this github, it is connected through Xampp (DB-name = forum) <br>


## Programming Languages, Frameworks and Tools used
* Xampp (Apache, PHPMyAdmin, mail service)
* PHP with Laravel framework
* Blade with vanilla CSS and JS
* Pusher for realtime chatroom (Not Added Yet)


### To Do For Me
* Add mail service
* Make a admin account which can edit and delete all post (perhaps an extra page for moderation)
* Pusher Chatroom
* Tailwind CSS?, questionable, can easily design great with vanilla CSS
